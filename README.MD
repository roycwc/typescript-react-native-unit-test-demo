# Blazing fast Unit testing for React Native propject in Typescript

Jest is slow

Using custom mocha compiler (compiler.js) to mock react native Component modules (react-native.mock.js)
so Enzyme shallow renderer in your mocha unit tests can traverse

Super fast iteration compared to Jest, suitable for test-driven development.

## Try it

Start test-driven development
```bash
npm ci
npm run testw
```

Start editing files in `tests/*` or `src/*`
